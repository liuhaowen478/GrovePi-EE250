"""python3 interpreters in Ubuntu (and other linux distros) will look in a
default set of directories for modules when a program tries to `import` one.
Examples of some default directories are (but not limited to):
  /usr/lib/python3.5
  /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages

The `sys` module, however, is a builtin that is written in and compiled in C for
performance. Because of this, you will not find this in the default directories.
